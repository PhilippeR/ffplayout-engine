# this is the time what the playout have, to change from one clip to the next
# be liberal with this value but dont exaggerate
# # buffer size gets calculate with: (v_bitrate * 0.125 + 281.25) * buffer_length
# by rawvideo calculation would be:
# (width x height * 3 / 2 * fps * buffer_length / 1024) + ((a_sample * 16 * 2 * buffer_length) / 8 / 1024)
# Size is in KB

# buffer_tolerance: ffmpeg holds material to in buffer, for this is the tolerance value
# a 1024x576 stream have around 2.5 seconds extra in buffer

# /usr/bin/pv -q -B or: /usr/bin/mbuffer -q -c -m
